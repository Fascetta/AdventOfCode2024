# Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! Advent of Code is an annual event featuring 25 days of fun and challenging programming puzzles. This repository contains my solutions, crafted with an emphasis on optimizing space and memory management.

## 📜 About

Advent of Code is an excellent opportunity to:
- Tackle algorithmic challenges in creative ways.
- Enhance problem-solving skills under constraints.
- Experiment with efficient code design.

In this repository, I am focusing on:
- Writing solutions without relying on external libraries.
- Designing algorithms that prioritize efficiency in both space and time complexity.
- Crafting clean and minimalistic code.

## 🔧 Languages & Tools
- **Primary Language**: Python
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks for better documentation and visualization.

## 🚀 Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

```
.
├── day_1/
│   ├── <problem_title>.ipynb
│   ├── puzzle_input.txt
├── day_2/
│   ├── <problem_title>.ipynb
│   ├── puzzle_input.txt
...
├── README.md
```

- Each folder (`day_X/`) corresponds to a specific day's challenge.
- `<problem_title>.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook with the solution, titled based on the day's problem.
- `puzzle_input.txt`: Contains the input data for the day's puzzle.

## 🧠 Strategy
1. **Understanding the Problem**: Carefully analyze the puzzle statement to identify constraints and edge cases.
2. **Designing Efficient Algorithms**: Focus on reducing unnecessary space and time usage.
3. **Implementation**: Write concise Python code without external libraries to maintain a lightweight solution.
4. **Testing and Optimization**: Validate against provided examples and actual inputs, then refine for better performance.

## 🤝 Feedback and Collaboration

I am eager to learn and improve! If you spot areas where the algorithms can be further optimized or the solutions can be made more elegant, please:
- Open an issue with your suggestion.
- Submit a pull request with your improvement.

All constructive feedback is welcome, especially ideas for refining space and memory management in the solutions.

## 🎯 Progress
| Day | Problem Title                | Part 1 | Part 2 |
|-----|------------------------------|--------|--------|
| 1   | `<Problem Title>`            | ✅      | ✅      |
| 2   | `<Problem Title>`            | ✅      | ✅      |
| 3   | `<Problem Title>`            | ❌      | ❌      |
| ... | ...                          | ...    | ...    |

This table will be updated as I progress through the event.
